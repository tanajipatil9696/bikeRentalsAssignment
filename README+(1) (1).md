## General Information
- This project aims to build a multiple linear regression model to predict bike sharing demand
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has experienced revenue decline during the Covid-19 pandemic
- The company wants to understand post-pandemic demand patterns to prepare their business strategy
- Dataset used: Bike sharing daily demand data spanning 2018-2019 with weather and seasonal information

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Temperature has the highest positive correlation with bike demand
- Clear weather conditions show positive impact on rentals
- Spring season shows negative correlation with bike demand
- Year over year trend shows increasing demand (2019 vs 2018)
- The model achieves R-squared value of 0.83 on test data
